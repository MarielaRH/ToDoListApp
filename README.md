# ToDoListApp 
This is an application made with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) 3.2.3 and [React](https://reactjs.org) 18.2.0 in which we can manage our daily tasks.

The main purpose of this application is to use the UseState and UseEffect hooks that React provides,
that code was written following good practices to make it easy to maintain and understand.

This project uses [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com) and [material tailwind react](https://www.material-tailwind.com) for the styles.
